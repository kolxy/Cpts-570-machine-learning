To run the program:
$ python3 Main.py

Python version = 3.8.2 64-bit

Output folder = ../assets
Output graph is through plt.show(). Graph images have to be manually saved.

Once the program starts running, input question numbers to run corresponding part of the code.
For example, 1a means 5.1 question a.
After 1c, each questions are divided into two parts: 1. perceptron. 2. PA 
Therefore the commands would be [1a, 1b, 1c] and [1d, 1d2, 2a, 2a2, 2b, 2b2, 2d, 2d2]

Because of limited time for running data, 2c is not implemented. 
Also, graphs aren't generated for 2a2 through 2d2, but the code is there and it works on a subset of data.
